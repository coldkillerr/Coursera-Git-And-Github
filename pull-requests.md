<h1> Pull Requests </h1>


As we called out, we can use `GitHub` to look at other people's code and
collaborate with them. 

We're trying to edit a file in a project that we don't have a right access to.
GitHub tells us it created a fork of this project for us,
which we can commit our changes to.
And if we submit changes to this file, it will create a new branch so
that we can send a pull request.


But what exactly is a `fork`?

Forking is a way of creating a copy of the given repository so
that it belongs to our user.
In other words, our user will be able to push changes to the forked copy,
even when we can't push changes to the other repo.
When collaborating on projects hosted on GitHub, the typical workflows,
first, create a fork of the repo, and then work on that local fork.


A `forked repo` is just like a normal repo,
except Github knows which repo it forked from.
So we can eventually merge our changes back into the main repo by creating
a pull request.


A `pull request` is a commit or series of commits that you send to the owner
of the repository so that they incorporate it into their tree.
This is a typical way of working on GitHub, because in most projects,
only a few people have commit rights to the repo.
But anybody can suggest patches, bug fixes or even new features by sending pull
requests that people with commit access can then apply.
Typically, the owners of the repo will review the changes before merging them.
Checking that they match the development guidelines for the project and
that the license is valid and so on. 


One way of doing this is through the `web application` .

Lets look at the other way
