<h1> Code Reviews </h1>


Doing a `code review` means going through someone else's `code`, `documentation` or
configuration and checking that it all makes sense and
follows the expected patterns.
The goal of a `code review` is to improve the project by making sure
that changes are high quality.
It also helps us make sure that the contents are easy to understand.
That the `style` is `consistent` with the overall project.
And that we don't forget any important cases.
Reviews increased the number of eyes that have checked the code.
This increases the code quality and reduces the amount of `bugs`.
It doesn't mean that there'll be no bugs, but
at least the most obvious bugs will be caught.
Also, this helps spread knowledge since both the code writers and
the code reviewers now know what the code is doing.
When we work in the same office as our teammates, we can do reviews in person by
looking together at the changes and discussing how the contents fit together.
